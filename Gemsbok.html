                   <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                   <p>These large mammals are successful in many different habitat types. If it has water for them to drink, and grass for them to eat, they usually don’t care what else is there.

Some of the different ecosystems that they inhabit include grasslands, savannas, bushlands, rainforests, mountains, woodlands, wetlands, marshes, and more. Their favorite habitats are riparian, or riverside, ecosystems that lie close to streams and rivers. The different subspecies of these animals prefer different habitat types.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE DO WE FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                   <P>Old World “true” buffalo (Cape buffalo and water buffalo) are native to Africa and Asia. Bison are found in North America and Europe. Both bison and buffalo are in the bovidae family, but the two are not closely related.</P>
