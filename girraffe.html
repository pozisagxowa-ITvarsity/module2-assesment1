                   <h3>GIRRAFFE</h3>
                   <p>The girraffe is an african artiodactyl mammmal, the tallest living terrestial animal and the largest ruminant. it is traditionally considered to be one species, giraffa cameloparadailis, with nine subspecies.>Long-Necked – Much of these creatures’ height comes from their lengthy necks, which can measure well over 6 feet long alone! You would think that this means they have much more neck bones than humans do… right? In reality, humans and giraffes have the same number of neck bones, also known as vertebrae. The only difference is that the giraffe’s seven vertebrae are super sized!
                       Horns… or Not Horns? </p>
                   <P>The hair-covered “horns” on the heads of these creatures are actually known as ossicones. Unlike horns, which are coated in keratin, ossicones have a coating of skin and fur. Ossicones are originally made of cartilage when they are grown, and harden into bone over time.</P>
<P>High Head – Their unusually long neck makes it difficult for blood to get to the brain. In order to pump blood to their brain and extremities, giraffes need large, strong hearts. Their hearts can be as much as two feet long, and weigh well over 25 lbs.! In comparison, the human heart weighs just 11 ounces.
                   High-Capacity Consumption</P>
                   <p> All of that biological trouble supporting extreme height pays off for these creatures. Being heads, and tails, and heads again, above the other herbivores means that giraffes don’t have any competitors in the food market. The average individual can eat 75 lbs. of plants per day</p>
